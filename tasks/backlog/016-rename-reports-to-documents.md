## Description
"Reports" implies analytical capability (aggregation, data-driven output) that the feature does not have. It is actually a versioned markdown document store.

Renaming to "Documents" sets more accurate expectations and is a more general label that covers specs, notes, design docs, etc.

This touches: directory name, API routes, UI labels, init scaffolding, CLAUDE.md, SKILL.md.
